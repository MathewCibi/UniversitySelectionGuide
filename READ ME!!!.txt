Hello!
I just wanted to let you know that if,
The website's rating and review system isn't loading for you,
It is not broken! I am using a free provider for hosting my REST API
This service automatically shuts down the web service if no traffic has been detected.
Simply wait a little bit until the provider starts the web service, It will start once
you open the review page as my website will send a request to the provider and letting them know 
that you need to use the service.

Thats all I wanted to say! Thank you for your time!
